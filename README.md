Here I mimic the methods used by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) for detecting gravitational waves using data generated by real numerical relativity simulations kindly made publicly available by one of the worldwide leading groups in simulating Binary Black Hole mergers: the Cen-ter for Computational Relativity and Gravitation (see http://ccrg.rit.edu/downloads/waveforms â€“ Campanelli, Lousto, Nakano, and Zlochower, Phys.Rev.
